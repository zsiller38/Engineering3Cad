## Teamwork Makes the Dream Work
### Ring and Spinner 4.1
#### Description
The first part of this project was to make either a spinner or a ring. I made the spinner. This part has groves on the bottom so the rip cord turns it quickly. It also has a helical grove on the upper half that the prop will slide into and then release from. We used an extrude and circular pattern to create the teeth on the bottom. We also used a curve and then a sweep to create a grove that spiraled around the spinner.

#### Reflection
This part had a lot of steps to follow and sometimes it took a while to figure out what dimensions to use. A trick to make the flipping between your document and the tutorial page is alt tab. This switches between your windows so you can keep them full screen and still navigate between them. The hardest part of this project was using the sweep tool. To use it you first need a curve to follow. I found it interesting that the curves you make are all put next to the part list. This made them easy to find later on when the prop was made. Learning the sweep tool was easy with the tutorial and it seems very usefull in creating some more unusal shapes. Other than that creating the spinner was easy and a little time consuming.

### Prop and Key 4.2

#### Description
The second part I made was the key. We first extruded the circular key handel and then made the shaft. We used a linear patern to copy the teeth along the whole shaft. Finally a mate was added to the base of where the handel meets the shaft to make the assembly to the main assembley.

#### Reflection
The key was by far the easiest part to create. It was just a basic extruded handel and a shaft with a linear patern cut into it to make the teeth. The use of the mate connector was something I had never done before but would prove very useful in the future. This part reminded me of the part I was making when I was first learning onshape and it is cool to see how far I have come.
### Assembly 4.3
#### Description
Finally we had to mate together our different parts. We used a revolve mate between the base of the spinner and the mount. A slider mate was used to allow the key to slide in and out of the hole on the mount. To make the spinner turn when the key is pulled we added a gear relation. To make sure the teeth lide up we used the section tool to cut away the top part of the model to see where the teeth are. Finally to complete the model we added 3 bolts to hold the ring and mount together.

#### Reflection
This was one of the easier assemblies I have had to do. There were relativly few parts so I did not take long. However, I would have taken far longer if we had not put the mate connector of the base of the key. This made it much easier to use a slider mate to fasten the key and mount. Creating mates in part of your model that might be hard to mate together can save a lot of time from fidiling around and using offsets. As for all the other parts of the assemley I had already used slider mates and gear relations but they are still very usefull. Same goes for mate limits, adding them can help you visualize what your finished model will look like. 

### Branching and Merging 4.4/4.5
#### Description
The goal of this module was to learn how to branch and merge in an onshape document. First we created a version which a snapshot of what the design looked like at the time the version was created. Then we branched the document. This allowed us to create a seperate workplace where we could edit the prop without affecting the main version. Finally when we found a new prop design we were happy with we merged the branch and main document into one.

#### Reflection
Learning about branching a merging was very cool. Just from my limited use I can see how incredibly helpful it can be. Branching and Merging was easy there was nothing very confusing or chalenging about it. It is one of the most useful tools in onshape and I would recomend using it whenever it makes sence. 

## Swing Arm

#### Description
Create a swing arm with 3 variables to adjust its side. The variable adjust the length of one side of the arm, the thickness of the two arms sticking out, and the degree between the two arms. The thickest part was the center circle (56mm) followed by the arms (40mm), and the connecting interior panel (21mm). It was made using one sketch and symetric extrusions, followed by two skeches on each arm for the hole on each end.

#### Reflection
This was the first time I had ever created a part from sketches. It was confusing at first but soon got the hang of it.
- When given a cross section regions that are shaded are solid. This is important because in a sketch it is hard to tell if something is hollow or not but this is how you can tell.
- Take some time figuring out the most logical place to start, this will save you time later.
- Don't make unecessary dimensions, this makes your sketch confusing and hard to read. Use relations instead, they are easier to create and if you are using variable sometimes unecessary dimensions can break your sketch when you change the variable, whereas relations will not. 

This was probably my favorite model to make and I enjoyed trying to create a model a different way without a tutorial telling you how.
## Multi Part Design Studios
#### Description
Create a piston like model that can move up and down. The cylinder is 145 mm tall and the tob and bottom plates are 100x100 mm and 40mm thick. The pins are all 195 mm with a diameter of 6.4 mm. The cylinder extends into the top and bottom plate by 30mm. The tapered hole where the piston is is made by revolving a sketch.

#### Reflection
This was the second project we did using sketches. The point of the project was to create multiple parts in one part studio by creating new extrucions rather than adding. Many of the dimension within the sketches where in parenthesies. This means that there dimensions are determined by other dimensions and when this occurs you sould use relations rather than dimensioning the part again. The hardest part of this project was the assembly as I spent quite awile creating the proper limits for the slider mate between the cylinder and piston. All that i neededwas some basic addition but this could be a time where creating a mate connector would have made it easier. Overall I like this project and I think I have gotten good at creating models from sketches.
