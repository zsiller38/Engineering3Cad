## Teamwork Makes the Dream Work
### Ring and Spinner 4.1
#### Description
The first part of this project was to make either a spinner or a ring. I made the spinner. This part has groves on the bottom so the rip cord turns it quickly. It also has a helical grove on the upper half that the prop will slide into and then release from. We used an extrude and circular pattern to create the teeth on the bottom. We also used a curve and then a sweep to create a grove that spiraled around the spinner.

### Prop and Key 4.2

#### Description
The second part I made was the key. We first extruded the circular key handel and then made the shaft. We used a linear patern to copy the teeth along the whole shaft. Finally a mate was added to the base of where the handel meets the shaft to make the assembly to the main assembley.
