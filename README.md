## Teamwork Makes the Dream Work
### Ring and Spinner 4.1
#### Description
The first part of this project was to make either a spinner or a ring. I made the spinner. This part has groves on the bottom so the rip cord turns it quickly. It also has a helical grove on the upper half that the prop will slide into and then release from. We used an extrude and circular pattern to create the teeth on the bottom. We also used a curve and then a sweep to create a grove that spiraled around the spinner.

### Prop and Key 4.2

#### Description
The second part I made was the key. We first extruded the circular key handel and then made the shaft. We used a linear patern to copy the teeth along the whole shaft. Finally a mate was added to the base of where the handel meets the shaft to make the assembly to the main assembley.

### Assembley
#### Description
Finally we had to mate together our different parts. We used a revolve mate between the base of the spinner and the mount. A slider mate was used to allow the key to slide in and out of the hole on the mount. To make the spinner turn when the key is pulled we added a gear relation. To make sure the teeth lide up we used the section tool to cut away the top part of the model to see where the teeth are. Finally to complete the model we added 3 bolts to hold the ring and mount together.

### Branching and Merging 4.4/4.5
#### Description
The goal of this module was to learn ho to branch and merge in an onshape document. First we created a version which a snapshot of what the design looked like at the time the version was created. Then we branched the document. This allowed us to create a seperate workplace where we could edit the prop without affecting the main version. Finally when we found a new prop design we were happy with we merged the branch and main document into one.
